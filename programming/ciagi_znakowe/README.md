You can write your own tests in file `custom.cpp` (file contains one example)

### Instruction

1. Replace dummy file `kod.cpp` with your code
2. Make sure you have `g++` in your PATH (type `g++` in terminal/`cmd.exe`)\*
3. Through command line\*\* (terminal or `cmd.exe`) navigate to this directory
4. Type `make` (on Windows it's only batch script mimicking Makefile)
5. Check results

\* &nbsp;Windows users should install MinGW

\*\* Windows users can alternatively just execute file `make.bat`

### Output

If test was successfully passed:
```
[GOOD]  | "returned string"
```

If test failed:
```
[ERROR] | "returned string" -> "correct answer"    { 'parameters' 'of' 'test' }
```

#### Note about imprecise behaviour of `FormatujNapis()`

Task content did not precised how function `FormatujNapis` should interpret formats like this one: `{u:3}{w:2}`.

Therefore tests assumed that `FormatujNapis("ABCD{u:3}{w:2}xyzFG, "d", "e", "f")` will result in `ABCDeFG`.

You do not need to worry about this - BaCa contains no such tests.

There, those will be denoted with `Checking FormatujNapis [negligible]`.
